Package: Payment_Destinations
Version: 1.0.0
Name: Direct Invoice Payment Destinations
Description: A "cash" sale deposits an automatically generated
 customer payment into the Cash account.  But what if you accept
 Interac, Debit or Credit payments?  You had to create a "payment due in X days"
 transaction and then manually generate a customer payment.
 This module traps the selected payment type and generates the payment into
 the associated GL.
